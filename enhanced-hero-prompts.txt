## 1. DALL-E 3 Optimized Prompt

**Prompt:**

"**Subject:** A breathtaking, architecturally significant luxury modern residence nestled within the exclusive Centennial Hills community of Las Vegas. The primary structure is a masterclass in contemporary design, featuring expansive, floor-to-ceiling, low-emissivity glass curtain walls that reflect the vibrant golden hour sky, seamlessly integrated with sophisticated, large-format natural stone cladding (specifically honed travertine and dark volcanic rock accents) that grounds the structure in the desert landscape. The design emphasizes clean lines, cantilevered elements, and a harmonious blend of indoor-outdoor living spaces.

**Setting & Environment:** The home is strategically positioned to capture panoramic, unobstructed views of the majestic Spring Mountains, their rugged peaks silhouetted against the warm, fading light. The immediate foreground showcases meticulously curated, drought-tolerant desert landscaping, including gracefully sculptural Joshua trees, vibrant barrel cacti, and strategically placed smooth river rocks. A subtle, meandering pathway made of decomposed granite leads towards the entrance, hinting at accessibility.

**Lighting & Atmosphere:** Captured during the 'golden hour,' approximately 30 minutes before sunset. The lighting is soft, warm, and highly directional, casting long, elegant shadows that define the architectural planes and add depth. The sky is a gradient of deep orange, soft pink, and subtle violet hues, with a few wispy cirrus clouds catching the last rays of sunlight. The overall mood is serene, aspirational, and evokes a sense of unparalleled luxury and tranquility.

**Photography Style & Technicals:** Professional real estate photography aesthetic. The image is composed with a wide-angle lens (simulating a 24mm full-frame equivalent) to capture the grandeur of the home and its surroundings. The perspective is slightly elevated, offering a commanding view of the property. Sharp focus on the architectural details, with a subtly diffused background to emphasize the home. High dynamic range (HDR) processing is evident, showcasing detail in both highlights and shadows without being overblown. The color palette is rich and natural, with warm undertones. The image possesses incredible clarity, sharpness, and a hyper-realistic texture.

**Composition:** The home is positioned slightly off-center to the left, following the rule of thirds, allowing the Spring Mountains to dominate the background and create a sense of vastness. A leading line from the landscape draws the eye towards the main entrance.

**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 cinematic widescreen.

**Keywords for Optimization:** Luxury real estate, modern architecture, desert home, Las Vegas, Centennial Hills, Spring Mountains view, golden hour, contemporary design, glass walls, stone accents, Joshua trees, professional photography, aspirational, high-end, bespoke, tranquil, panoramic, architectural masterpiece, hyperrealistic, HDR, wide-angle."

## 2. Midjourney Optimized Prompt

**Prompt:**

`/imagine prompt: A hyper-realistic, aspirational hero shot of a bespoke luxury modern residence in the exclusive Centennial Hills, Las Vegas. The architecture features striking cantilevered elements, vast floor-to-ceiling low-iron glass walls reflecting a vibrant golden hour sky, and seamless integration of large-format honed travertine and dark volcanic rock cladding. The home is strategically positioned to boast unobstructed, panoramic views of the majestic Spring Mountains, their peaks silhouetted against a gradient sunset sky of burnt orange, rose gold, and soft violet.

The foreground showcases meticulously curated desert xeriscaping: artfully placed mature Joshua trees, sculptural barrel cacti, and natural river rock accents creating a serene, inviting pathway leading to the entrance. Lighting is 'magic hour' soft, warm, directional sunlight, casting long, elegant shadows that define architectural forms and add profound depth. The atmosphere is one of unparalleled tranquility and high-end sophistication.

Photography style: Professional architectural photography, wide-angle lens perspective (simulating 24mm), slightly elevated eye-level shot. Crisp focus on the home's intricate details with a subtly compressed background to emphasize the grandeur. High dynamic range (HDR) rendering for exceptional detail in both highlights and shadows. Rich, natural color palette with warm undertones. Immaculate clarity, tack-sharpness, and photo-realistic textures. --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6.0 --s 750 --q 2 --c 15`

**Midjourney Parameter Breakdown:**

*   **`--ar 16:9`**: Sets the aspect ratio to widescreen, ideal for hero shots.
*   **`--style raw`**: Encourages Midjourney V6 to produce a less stylized, more photographically realistic output. Essential for architectural photography.
*   **`--v 6.0`**: Specifies the use of Midjourney Version 6, which offers superior photorealism and prompt adherence.
*   **`--s 750`**: (Stylize) Controls how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic is applied. A higher value like 750 (out of 1000) allows for a more artistic but still grounded interpretation, while maintaining realism. Lower values might be too 'flat'.
*   **`--q 2`**: (Quality) Specifies high rendering quality. A value of 2 uses more GPU time but produces significantly more detailed and refined images.
*   **`--c 15`**: (Chaos) A lower chaos value (0-100) ensures the image sticks very closely to the prompt. 15 is low enough to maintain control but allows for a touch of creative interpretation by the AI.

The overall illumination creates a serene, sophisticated, and inviting atmosphere.

**Composition & Perspective:** Wide-angle lens perspective (simulating a 24mm or 28mm full-frame equivalent), slightly elevated eye-level shot to capture the grandeur of the home and its expansive surroundings. The home is positioned according to the rule of thirds, allowing the breathtaking mountain vista to be a prominent secondary element. Leading lines from the landscape guide the viewer's eye towards the architectural focal point.
