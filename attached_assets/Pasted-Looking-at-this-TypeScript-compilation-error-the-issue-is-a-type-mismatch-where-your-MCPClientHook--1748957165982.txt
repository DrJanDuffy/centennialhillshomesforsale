Looking at this TypeScript compilation error, the issue is a type mismatch where your MCPClientHook type definition doesn't include the mcpClient property that your actual hook implementation is returning.
Problem Analysis
The error occurs because:

Your hook is returning an object that includes mcpClient
Your MCPClientHook type interface doesn't declare this property
TypeScript enforces strict type checking during compilation

Immediate Solution
Step 1: Locate your MCP hook type definition
Find where MCPClientHook is defined (likely in a types file or at the top of your hook file).
Step 2: Update the type interface
Add the missing mcpClient property to your type definition:
typescript// Update your MCPClientHook interface to include mcpClient
interface MCPClientHook {
  mcpClient: YourMCPClientType | null; // Replace with actual client type
  isConnected: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
  // ... any other properties your hook returns
}
Step 3: If you don't have the exact client type, use a temporary generic approach:
typescriptinterface MCPClientHook {
  mcpClient: any; // Temporary - replace with proper type later
  isConnected: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
}
Complete Type Safety Solution
Option A: Define proper MCP client type
typescript// Define your MCP client interface
interface MCPClient {
  connect(): Promise<void>;
  disconnect(): void;
  sendMessage(message: any): Promise<any>;
  // Add other methods your client uses
}

interface MCPClientHook {
  mcpClient: MCPClient | null;
  isConnected: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
}
Option B: Infer type from hook implementation
typescript// Let TypeScript infer the return type from your hook
const useMCPClient = () => {
  // Your hook implementation
  return {
    mcpClient,
    isConnected,
    isLoading,
    error
  };
};

// Extract the type automatically
type MCPClientHook = ReturnType<typeof useMCPClient>;
Verification Steps

Check your hook implementation - ensure it actually returns mcpClient
Verify import paths - confirm you're importing the correct type
Test the build - run npm run build to verify the fix

Prevention Strategy
To avoid similar issues:
typescript// Use this pattern for type-safe custom hooks
export const useMCPClient = (): MCPClientHook => {
  // Implementation here
  const result = {
    mcpClient,
    isConnected,
    isLoading,
    error
  };
  
  // This ensures return type matches interface
  return result;
};
Would you like me to help you identify the exact type definition file that needs updating, or do you need assistance with defining the proper types for your MCP client?
